## Enabling AI-powered generic secret detection for your repository

To use generic secret detection, an enterprise owner must first set a policy at the enterprise level that controls whether repositories can enable or disable AI detection. This policy is set to "allowed" by default.

You can then enable the feature in the "Code security and analysis" settings page of your repository.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-code-security-and-analysis %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-ghas-settings %}
1. Under "Secret scanning", select the checkbox next to "Use AI detection to find additional secrets".

## Enabling AI-powered generic secret detection for your organizations

To use generic secret detection, an enterprise owner must first set a policy at the enterprise level that controls whether repositories in an organization can enable or disable AI detection. This policy is set to "allowed" by default.

You can then enable the feature in the security settings page of your organization.

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.profile.org_settings %}
1. In the "Security" section of the sidebar, click **{% octicon "codescan" aria-hidden="true" %} Code security** then **Global settings**.
1. Under "Secret scanning", select the checkbox next to "Use AI detection to find additional secrets".
